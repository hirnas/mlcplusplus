Check TensorFlow Installation: Make sure you have TensorFlow installed on your system, and the C++ header files are accessible. If you installed TensorFlow using pip, you can try installing the C++ headers explicitly with the following command:

Copy code
pip install tensorflow-cpp

Include Paths: Make sure you've added the correct include paths to your project settings. In most cases, you'll need to include the directory where TensorFlow header files are located. This could be something like:

css
Copy code
-I/path/to/tensorflow/include
